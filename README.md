## 📋 Project Overview

In today's world, data is growing at an exponential rate. Whether it’s PDFs, DOCX files, plain text, or URLs on the web, information is everywhere, and finding the right piece of data can be incredibly time-consuming. The problem we identified is the challenge of searching for specific, relevant information quickly and accurately amidst this sea of data.

### 💡 Problem Statement
Imagine needing to find a specific piece of information—such as procedures or details from a document—without having to read through hundreds of pages. Manual searching can be not only **boring** but also **time-consuming**, with no guarantee that you’ll find the right answer. Our project tackles this problem by offering an AI-powered solution to enhance search efficiency and accuracy.

Our application functions like a **chatbot** that leverages the power of **large language models (LLMs)** combined with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide highly accurate and contextually relevant answers. It’s designed to understand natural language queries and retrieve the most relevant information from your files and links.

### Key Features
- **File Formats Supported**: 
  - PDFs
  - DOCX
  - Text files

  - Upload URLs for website content to be searched
- **Quick and Accurate Search**:
  - Our assistant allows users to upload a variety of data sources and quickly find the information they need without manual reading.

### How It Works
- Users input a question in natural language.
